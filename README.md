This GUI program takes advance of tkinter library to visually-friendly calculate the determinant of a 2x2, 3x3 or 4x4 size matrix. The information about the matrix is meant to be extracted from a '.txt' file. New version of this that takes information from '.xml' is to be expected soon.
In the Matrix.txt, the distribution of matrix's info is supposed to be like:
1. Number of arrow(s).
2. Number of column(s).
3 and below. Value's of matrix separated by a TAB or '\t'.
